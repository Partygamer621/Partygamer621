Heya, I am Party! I mainly code in HTML/JavaScript/CSS but i have also taken a class on Python, 
I'm currently learning how to use Electron to make windows apps, so any advice you can give me would be very much appreciated

To code, i use Visual Studio for computer related stuff, and DroidScript for android apps
